# Calculator Project

This project is part of [The Odin Project's Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator). It involves creating an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Personal Reflections

1. **Complexity Management**: The project required handling numerous conditions, which felt overwhelming at times. In the future, I plan to refactor the code to simplify these conditions and enhance maintainability.

2. **Codebase Growth**: Initially, I didn't include comments in the code. As the codebase expanded and new features were added, some existing functionalities broke. Interestingly, I could intuitively identify and fix the issues without comments, which was a novel experience for me.

3. **Enjoyment and Focus**: Working on this project was enjoyable and calming. I found myself less distracted and more focused while coding, making the experience both productive and therapeutic.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Future Improvements

- Simplify complex conditions to improve code readability and maintainability.
- Implement additional features like parentheses handling and memory functions.
- Enhance error handling for invalid inputs.
- Add keyboard input support.
